    <h2>Fundraising</h2>
        <p>WYSA supports approximately 50% of its operations with donations and fundraising. 20% of our budget covers administrative fees (mostly insurance and subscription to TeamSnap). Registration fees cover about half of each sport's costs. The rest is made up by sponsorships, fundraising, and donations.</p>
        <p>In addition to paying for uniforms, equipment, league fees, and offials, a portion of our funds goes to scholarships for families who cannot afford full registration fees, especially for our winter ski and snowboard program.</p>
