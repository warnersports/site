                <h3>Saturday, April 20, 9:30am at Cafe One East</h3>
                <p>All our encouraged to attend the annual WYSA open board meeting at Cafe One East at 9:30am on Saturday, April 20. 
                This meeting would normally be to vote in new board members. So far two individuals have responded to our recent solicitation
                but as of yet no one has volunteered for any positions. <strong>Free coffee and cookies!</strong> Bring your bicycle to have it
                checked at Bike Check-up at 10am being offered by another organization. And perhaps stay and buy lunch at Cafe One East.</p>

                <p>
                    After-school soccer will be held at Simonds School four Wednesdays in May (8, 15, 22, and 29; <strong>not the 1st</strong>). Our provider 
                    this year is <a href="https://soccerskillscamp.org/" target="_blank>">Caramba Soccer Skills Camp.</a> This is open to Pre-K
                    through 5th graders, and will be $15 per participant. WYSA will provide a chaperone to take attendance at 
                    release from school at 2:50pm, and the program will run from 3pm to 4pm. Any questions, or if you're interested in 
                    being our new Soccer Director, please contact <a href="mailto:president@warnersports.org" target="_blank">Nathan Kendrick</a>.

                    Volunteers Needed
                </h3>
              
                <p>
                    It's time for a new generation to step up to run WYSA.

                <p>
                    Our Treasurer and Softball Director will be departing this summer. Our Soccer Director departed last fall. 
                    We have been in need of a Vice President, a Volunteer Coordinator, and a Fundraising Coordinator for some time.
                    Our President, Secretary, Social Media Manager, and Baseball Director will be departing soon as our 
                    children age out. Our Ski/Snowboard Director would probably like to hand off the reins, too; he's been doing it a while.
                </p>
                <p>If we don't get new volunteers, it will be the end of local youth sports in Warner.
                    Please 
                    <a href='mailto:contact@warnersports.org'>contact our Board</a> to inquire how you can help
                    keep our organization going for local kids in the years ahead.

                    This has been a <em>banner year</em> (pun intended) for sponsorships. In addition to all our baseball and softball teams receiving uniform
                    sponsors, we have received <strong>ten</strong> advertising banner sponsorships so far this year, with two more expected. See our
                    <a href="sponsors.html">sponsors page</a> to see all our current and past sponsors, and be sure to thank them and make use of their services.
